# Open3D

Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python.

## Core features of Open3D include:

- 3D data structures
- 3D data processing algorithms
- Scene reconstruction
- Surface alignment
- 3D visualization
- Physically based rendering (PBR)
- 3D machine learning support with PyTorch and TensorFlow
- GPU acceleration for core 3D operations
- Available in C++ and Python
